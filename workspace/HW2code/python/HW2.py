ME461 -- Intro Python UI that talks to a TI RedBoard microcontroller
===================================================================

WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES
----------------------
This is a small desktop application (a "GUI" -- graphical user interface)
built with Python's built-in ``tkinter`` library.  It does two things at once:

  1. PYTHON -> REDBOARD:  When you click a button in the window, Python sends
     the current state of 16 LEDs to the RedBoard over a USB serial port.
     All 16 on/off values are packed into a single 16-bit number and sent as
     text, e.g.  "5\\r\\n"  (5 in binary is 0000000000000101, so LED 1 and
     LED 3 are ON, everything else OFF).

  2. REDBOARD -> PYTHON:  Every 50 milliseconds Python checks the serial port
     for a line of text coming back from the RedBoard.  That line is a single
     number whose lowest 4 bits are the states of 4 push buttons.  Python
     unpacks those bits and recolors on-screen indicator circles.

HOW TO READ THIS FILE IF YOU ARE NEW TO PYTHON
---------------------------------------------
Jump to the very bottom first (the ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` block) --
that is where the program actually starts.  Then come back up to the
``LEDControlGUI`` class and read ``__init__`` from top to bottom, because that
method runs once at startup and builds the entire window.

Comments that start with "PYTHON:" point out a general language feature that is
worth learning and reusing elsewhere.  Other comments explain what this
specific program is doing.

WHAT YOU NEED INSTALLED
-----------------------
* Python 3 (``tkinter`` comes with it).
* pyserial:  run  ``pip install pyserial``  once in a terminal.

# PYTHON: `import` brings in code written by other people so we can use it.
# `import X as Y` gives the module a short nickname (`Y`) for the rest of this
# file, so we can type `tk.Button` instead of `tkinter.Button`.
import tkinter as tk

# PYTHON: `from MODULE import NAME` imports just one piece of a module, so we
# can write `messagebox` instead of `tkinter.messagebox`.
from tkinter import messagebox

# `serial` (the pyserial package) is NOT built into Python -- install it with
# `pip install pyserial`.  It lets Python read and write a serial ("COM") port,
# which is how the RedBoard appears to the computer when plugged in over USB.
import serial


# PYTHON: names written in ALL_CAPS at the top of a file are a convention for
# "constants" -- values you set once here and never change while the program
# runs.  Keeping them together makes them easy to find and edit.
#
# On Windows a port looks like "COM20".  On macOS/Linux it looks like
# "/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX" or "/dev/ttyUSB0".  Use the Arduino IDE's port
# menu or your OS device manager to find the right name, then edit this line.
SERIAL_PORT = "COM62"

# Baud rate = bits per second on the serial wire.  This number MUST match the
# value the RedBoard firmware uses (e.g. `Serial.begin(115200);` in the C code),
# or the two sides will exchange garbage.
BAUD_RATE = 115200


# PYTHON: `class` defines a new kind of object -- a bundle of data
# ("attributes") plus functions that work on that data ("methods").  We create
# exactly one object of this class at the bottom of the file.  By convention,
# class names use CapWords.
class LEDControlGUI:
    # PYTHON: `__init__` is the "constructor".  It runs automatically once, the
    # moment you create the object, and is where you set up the object's
    # starting state.  `self` is the object being built; EVERY method receives
    # it as the first parameter.  Anything you want to keep after the method
    # returns must be stored on `self` (e.g. `self.led1`), not in a plain local
    # variable.  `root` is the main window; it is handed in from the code at
